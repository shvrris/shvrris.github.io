This is my personal github account utilizing my personal email - shaunh82@gmail.com
The repository I created is shvrris.github.io
I followed the directions within the LAB to clone my repository. I downloaded Github desktop and upon opening in VS Code it allowed me to clone my repository there so that I could edit the README file
